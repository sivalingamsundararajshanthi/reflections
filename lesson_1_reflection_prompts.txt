How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    
I was able to find the bug so that it can be corrected.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
 efficient programmer in the long term?

    
We can revert back to previous version of a file if we mess up.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
pros:
For small files this is fine.

cons:
For larger files this can become tedious.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
Version control systems save the same file while google docs saves the same file in different format.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

If we mess up we can go back to the older version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros:
The commits are reasonable.

cons:
We can forget to commit which can and will lead to disaster.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

That's because git stores project files as repos.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log is used to view the history of commits
diff is used to see lines that were added or deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
