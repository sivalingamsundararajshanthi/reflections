What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This is used to initialize the directory as a repository and it doesn't have any commits yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It acts as a intermediate layer between the working directory and the commit. This is used to keep track of all the files we need to commit.
